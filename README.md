Info:     This application will manage PolicyKit policies for the end user. gksudo is no longer
          included with Ubuntu, with the common argument being to use pkexec instead. However,
          using GUI applications with pkexec can be time-consuming if one has to write policies
          for them manually. Additonally, this tempts novice users to just use sudo, which can be a
          security concern. For security reasons, this app only manages policies it creates.

Note:     Not in usable state yet, do not use.
